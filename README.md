# README Generator

## Description

In this week's assignment, we had to create a README generator using node.js. JavaScript was only used during this project, and required npm install of package.jason.
The user answers a series of questions, that will then generate a README file with the answers provided within. User needs to run using node index.js in order for questiosn to appear in terminal. User can regenerate the README file as many times as required. License image also appears depending on license chosen for project.

## What was done?

Initially install of package.jason had to be completed and files provided linked to index.js in order to refer to them within the code. A series of questions had to be created as well by creating and array to then refer to data (the questions answered), and creating a README and running using init function. Terminal needs to be opened and node index.js run in order for user to iniate the test run for the README. The README also had to be organized in an appropriate manner within the JS file, that is linked to the index.js.
